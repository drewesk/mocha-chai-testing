## Description

This is a basic practice project using **Mocha** as the test framework and **Chai** for assertions.  
The purpose is to test simple utility methods and get familiar with writing assertions using Chai's `assert` style.

### Tested Methods

- `sayHello()` – returns a simple greeting.
- `addNumbers(x, y)` – returns the sum of two numbers.
- `isEven(num)` – checks if a number is even.
- `reverseString(str)` – reverses a given string.
- `getUser()` – returns a sample user object.
- `fetchItems()` – returns a sample array of items.
- `isNull()` – returns `null`.
- `throwIfNegative(num)` – throws an error for negative numbers.
